# Building-a-Security-Monitoring-Environment

Built a security monitoring environment with Splunk. In this environment, I loaded, analyzed, and created baselines for Windows and Apache logs to create reports, alerts, and dashboards for a mock organization. The organization experienced a simulated attack that tested my security monitoring environment, but was detected.

This repository includes screenshots of the reports, alerts, and dashboards of the security monitoring environment.
